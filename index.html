    <h1> OpenSrcSTEM </h1>
    <p>
        OpenSrcSTEM was developed over the course of a semester by group of fellow students and myself.
        A large aspect of this project was the design, the following image is the final design of the architecture.
    </p>
    <img src="img/updated.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: 50%; margin-bottom: 5px;">
    <p>
        We used HTML, CSS, and JS for the front end. On the backend we had MongoDB for the database and NodeJS for the routing/backend logic.
        This technology stack was chosen because each member of the group wanted to learn these newer technologies and build something cool. The following image is a close approximation to how the website looked.
    </p>
    <img src="img/educators_page.png" style="width: 100%; height: 50%; margin-bottom: 5px;">
    <p>
        The point of this project was to create an application in which educators could share resources with each other, we wanted to create a hub for educators to share and monetize their work. However, over the
        development process, it devolved more into a Facebook-Canvas hybrid. Soon after its creation we realize that our idea was already a successful company, TeachersPayTeachers. If only we were born 10 years earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was made before I had my first internship, so this project gave me a lot of growing pains (aka trial by fire). I learned how to work with and lead a team, and how to set achievable goals for a project.
        I also later learned the beauty of version control using Git, because we had many merge errors that occurred. Surprisingly this project ended up receiving honorable mentions, and even with all of the trials and
        tribulations, we created a decent, working application which impressed our professor.

    <h1> Mathematical Libraries </h1>
    <p>
        On my <span class="underline white" href="https://github.com/Sovann20">github</span> I have various mathematical libraries which are designed to be used in a future project. I wrote all the code in C++ because I want to use
        various libraries to create a rudimentary graphics engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create these libraries I used C++ and Vim. By coding in C++, I have become a better C++ programmer, also I've become better at testing my code and ensuring correct results from personally created APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm interested in programming tools for video game development and creating these libraries are a good way for me to learn, and work towards my goal of a developing a rudimentary graphics engine from scratch.
        The current libraries I have created are matrices, quaternions, and various numerical root finding algorithms. These libraries are not perfect and they still require more mathematical functions, but I'm not worried
        because I enjoy working on this project and it continues to help me strengthen linear algebraic concepts.

    <h1> UDP/TCP Communication </h1>
    <p>
        I'm currently minoring in Cyber Security and to better familiarize myself with Networking concepts, I implemented some low level communication over sockets on a local network. The following is a snippet of some client code
        in C.
    </p>
    <img src="img/client_code.png" style="width: 100%; length: 50%; margin-bottom: 5px;">
    <p>
        By using C and it's native libraries to communicate over sockets, it has strengthen my networking fundamentals and helped me understand more complex concepts such as WiFi, bluetooth, ...
        A lot of communication between devices and applications is implemented using sockets, the data is converted into bytes (generally encrypted), and knowing how that data is decrypted and turned into
        human-readable data is invaluable as a software engineer.

                <div id="c01" class="content content-width-no-resume">

                    My name is Sovann Chak, I attend Iowa State University. I started my journey into programming about 3 years ago when
                    I began attending uni. Compared to many of my peers at the time, I had little to no experience in the world of
                    computer science. However, I became quickly involved with my work and dedicated to catching up.

                    <br/><br/>

                    Like many in the industry, I initially became interested in computer science due to video games
                    - so I decided to study software engineering. As I've become more involved with my work/major I have drifted away
                    from gaming - however learning the science behind it has made me much more involved
                    and passionate about applied computer science.

                    <br/><br/>

                    As I continue my journey, there are many things which I am uncertain of. However, I am certain that I want to work
                    somewhere where I am constantly learning, being challenged and creating.

                </div>

                <div id="c02" class="content content-width-no-resume">

                    Some of my latest technical interests have been computer graphics, geometric modeling, and computer vision. Applying linear algebra
                    to my computer science knowledge has been a fun and challenging experience.

                    <br/><br/>

                    I also find relaxation in a nice double americano, and I like to travel to different hackathons around
                    the states, and cooking for my friends from time to time - even if they don't compliment the meal..
